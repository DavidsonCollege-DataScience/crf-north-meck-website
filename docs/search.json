    "text": "In 2024, Mecklenburg ranked in the top 10 wealthiest counties in North Carolina. While families across Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville maintain high household incomes in comparison to the state average, North Mecklenburg is not monolithic. The perception that North Mecklenburg is exclusively wealthy leaves many families behind, including several communities of color.\nA long history of segregation and redlining impacts residents in historically African American neighborhoods such as Pottstown, West Davidson, and Smithville, as well as the predominantly Hispanic/Latinx neighborhood Huntington Green. North Mecklenburg data often eclipses or excludes the experiences within these communities.\nThis website intends to provide more insight into the experiences of all North Mecklenburg residents, inclduing both resources and data analysis."

    "text": "The Community Research Fellows program launched in 2020 as a collaboration between the Davidson College Center for Civic Engagement and the Data CATS program. Each summer over an 8-week period, a small cohort of Davidson students engages in place-based research in partnership with local community leaders, supported by faculty advisors. \nThe inaugural cohort in 2020 completed a needs assessment of the North Mecklenburg community through conducting a series of surveys, focus groups, and interviews. The fellows developed a North Mecklenburg Needs Assessment Summary Report, Data Dashboard, and Community Research Library Guide to index research and data on social issues in the greater Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. In 2021, fellows continued exploring the key focus areas identified in the 2020 Needs Assessment: housing, healthcare, and childcare. The team conducted research, held focus groups, and developed a survey that was administered to focus neighborhoods in North Mecklenburg. In 2022, fellows completed the 2021 report, developed a data dashboard, and finalized research documents to summarize findings from prior summers using data visualizations. In 2023, the fellows collaborated with the Center for Racial Equity in Education (CREED) on research projects related to North Carolina School Boards and created a data dashboard. In 2024, fellows collaborated with historian Hilary Green and the Davidson College Archives, utilizing AI to make historical issues of The Davidsonian student publication accessible on Open Davidson. In 2025, the most recent cohort created an updated North Mecklenburg data dashboard hosted on this website, providing a central location for both data and resources specific to the North Meck community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n\n\n\n\nNeeds Assessment Report, Dashboard, and Library Guide\nFurther research into housing, healthcare, and childcare\nNorth Meck Dashboard & Report\nE(race)ing Inequities Dashboard with CREED\nOpen Davidson archive search\n(our project overview)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavidsonian Archives Project\nE(race)ing Inequities Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllie is a Computer Science major from Seattle, Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalli is a Sociology major and Data Science minor from Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaby is a Psychology major and Anthropology minor from Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick is Data Science major and German Studies minor from New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah is an Anthropology major and Data Science minor from Beaumont, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKerem is a Computer Science major and Data Science minor from Bursa, Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary Elizabeth is a Political Science major and Data Science minor from Asheville, NC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilo was a Computer Science major, Data Science minor and is currently working in data engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler was a Computer Science major, Data Science minor and is currently working as a Data Analyst & Research Assistant for the City of Boston Planning Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwen was a Political Science major and is currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science and Business Analytics at UNC Charlotte.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalavika was a Mathematics and Computer Science major and currently works as an Analyst in Data & Automation at SP Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuey was a Computer Science and Economics double major and is currently working in data/business analytics and software engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane was a Psychology major, Communication Studies minor and currently works as an Admissions Analyst at Georgetown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrynn was a Data Science major, Computer Science minor and currently works as a Data Scientist & Analyst at Trane Technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn was an Economics major and currently works as a Data Scientist at New Balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSohan was an Economics major, Data Science minor and currently works as a Junior Product Manager on the International Merchandising Technology Team at Walmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler was a Political Science major and currently works as an Implementation Manager at McMaster-Carr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSavanna was a Digital & Computational Studies major, Gender & Sexuality Studies minor and is currently studying in Clemson’s Master of Education in Student Affairs Program while working as the Graduate Community Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryce was a Computer science major, Applied Mathematics minor and currently works in data analytics, machine learning, and generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarnet was an Economics major, Data Science minor and currently works as a Product Manager at Red Ventures"

# Community Research Fellows (CRF) Program

The [Community Research Fellows](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/civic-engagement/community-based-experiential-learning/community-based-research){style="text-decoration: none"} program launched in 2020 as a collaboration between the Davidson College Center for Civic Engagement and the Data CATS program. Each summer over an 8-week period, a small cohort of Davidson students engages in place-based research in partnership with local community leaders, supported by faculty advisors. 

The inaugural cohort in 2020 completed a needs assessment of the North Mecklenburg community through conducting a series of surveys, focus groups, and interviews. The fellows developed a [North Mecklenburg Needs Assessment Summary Report](https://inkandbolts.com/CRF_Final_Report.html){style="text-decoration: none"}, [Data Dashboard](https://inkandbolts.com/CRF_Data_Dashboard.html#about){style="text-decoration: none"}, and [Community Research Library Guide](https://davidson.libguides.com/communityresearch){style="text-decoration: none"} to index research and data on social issues in the greater Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. In 2021, fellows continued exploring the key focus areas identified in the 2020 Needs Assessment: housing, healthcare, and childcare. The team conducted research, held focus groups, and developed a survey that was administered to focus neighborhoods in North Mecklenburg. In 2022, fellows completed the [2021 report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTnSDVM06kyDJu52_LUEVip2Ohjwuf-AJ-Wxc9JNlEHCgjE84Imw8Xa7q2IaEPCZa_g8cia1WtmqDYk/pub){style="text-decoration: none"}, developed a [data dashboard](https://crf-dashboard.rc.davidson.edu){style="text-decoration: none"}, and finalized research documents to summarize findings from prior summers using data visualizations. In 2023, the fellows collaborated with the Center for Racial Equity in Education (CREED) on research projects related to North Carolina School Boards and created a [data dashboard](https://creed-nc.shinyapps.io/CREED-NC-Dashboard/){.uri style="text-decoration: none"}. In 2024, fellows collaborated with historian Hilary Green and the Davidson College Archives, utilizing AI to make historical issues of The Davidsonian student publication accessible on [Open Davidson](https://open.davidson.edu){.uri style="text-decoration: none"}. In 2025, the most recent cohort created an updated North Mecklenburg data dashboard hosted on this website, providing a central location for both data and resources specific to the North Meck community.
